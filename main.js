/* 
You are walking to the local coffee shop, entering at the north west corner of a
 square in the city centre, when you see a doughnut, lying abandoned on the 
 floor, sprinkles scattered haphazardly around. Senses tingling and adrenaline 
 surging, you notice a traces of jam and powdered sugar scattered around the 
 area, suggesting signs of a struggle. You are intruiged and decide to 
 investigate further, when it suddenly flips onto it's side and rolls away. You 
 chase after the magical doughnut, whilst trying to reassure it you mean it no 
 harm. Luckily it is early in the morning, and no-one is around to witness your 
 seeming loss of grip with reality.

Whilst chasing the doughnut, you realise it is moving in a peculiar pattern. 

It only moves directly south, or directly east, by one paving slab at a time, 
and it appears to be coincidentally heading towards the same local coffee shop, 
the building directly south-east from you.

In your efforts to capture the fleeing doughnut, you try to predict how many 
different paths it can take to reach the shop. This will depend on the size of 
the square, which can be rectangular, given as (x,y)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a grid size, (x,y), calculate the unique possible paths that can be taken 
whilst chasing the doughnut, only moving south and east. Return the number of 
paths as an integer. If the input does not contain two positive integers, return
 an error "Invalid Input!"
